    Refactored all tests to add in display names for each test. Also created a beforeEach method that creates colours objects, minimising some code.
    
    Lastly reduced the number of assertions and confirmed they all still work properly.

    Implemented entire colours class with all methods and constructors. Added a new constructor in class and changed it in splitRGB method.
    
    Added equals test in test class.

    Overrided equals method but found out that single constructor colour had flawed logic in it from trying to test the equals method.
    
    Initially had it accept octal numbers unknowingly but now properly accepts any integer values between 0 and 16777215.
    
    Changed constructor, constants and tests around it and works fine now.

    Added new constant in class, assuming that the rgb values would always be between 0 and 255. Also refactored min and max to be constants through uppercase.
    
    Added additional constructor of Colour class accepting rgb values with red in bits 16-23, green in bits 8-15 and blue in bits 0-7.
    
    Added new method splitRGB which splits the rgb values too. Added exception after using tests in file that the constructor would fail on rgb values not of length 9.
    
    Added 2 new tests in ColourTest to make sure new constructor was working okay.

    Added Colour class with 1 constructor to take in 3 appropriate rgb values in with proper encapsulation of class variables.
    
    Also added in test classes that test the constructor if they constructor accepts correct and incorrect values which both work.
    
    Also added maven dependency on junit5 in pom.xml.
